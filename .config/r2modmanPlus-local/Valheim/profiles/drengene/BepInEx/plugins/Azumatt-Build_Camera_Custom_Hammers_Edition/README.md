`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

Fork from [Build Camera](https://github.com/gittywithexcitement/ValheimBuildCamera) (CookieMilk's version specifically)

# Usage

1. Equip your hammer,
2. Go within build range of a build station (e.g. a workbench),
3. Press B (default - can be changed in config) to activate the build camera.
4. The camera is now disconnected from your avatar. Look around and move as usual (e.g. using mouse and keyboard); use
   jump (Space) to go up and stealth (Control) to go down. Hold run (Shift) to move the camera faster. Gamepad users:
   left trigger and right trigger move the camera up and down. Right joystick turns the camera. Left joystick pans the
   camera left, right, forward, and backward.
5. Build (left click) and choose items to build (right click) as usual.

## Other details

* This mod changes how far from a work station you're able to build to several times the game default, see the
  configuration options Distance_Can_Build_From_Avatar and Distance_Can_Build_From_Workbench. There was much demand for
  this feature.
* Deactivate build mode by unequipping the hammer or pressing B or R (the keybind for "hide" weapons).
* Also works with the hoe and the cultivator.
* The camera must stay within the build area, although the range is configurable with Camera_Range_Multiplier.

# Installation

1. Install [BepInEx for Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2. Place `BuildCameraCHE.dll` in your BepInEx plugins directory, like
   this: `Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\plugins\BuildCameraCHE.dll`.

# Configuration

Start the game with the plugin installed, then edit the file `\BepInEx\config\Azumatt.BuildCameraCHE.cfg`. There are
several configurable options:

* Distance Can Build From Avatar
* Distance Can Build From Workbench
* Toggle build mode hotkey
* Camera Move Speed Multiplier
* Camera Range Multiplier
* Move With Respect To World
* Verbose Logging

# Incompatible with

* Valheim Plus first person mode. Sorry, ValheimPlus would have to provide compatibility in their mod, both mods are
  taking over the camera.
* Masa's FirstPerson mod, on R2ModManager

# Compatible with

* My [FirstPersonMode](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/FirstPersonMode/) mod, on [Thunderstore's Valheim Community mods](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/)
* I've been told Build Camera is compatible with with kailen37's FirstPerson mod on nexusmods.com. I haven't tested it
  myself.
